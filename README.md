# Peaks and Valleys #
## summary ##
Summary: This is a representation of an algorithm that was once presented 
as a coding challenge.

* A sequence of numbers is generated according to a few simple rules generating the peaks
* The sequence is converted to a line drawn on the HTML canvas
* I wrote an algorithm that then searches the landscape for valleys and fills those with water
